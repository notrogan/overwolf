### Load as unpacked extension.

You can load the native version of this app "as is", without any build process. Open the `ts` directory in a code editor, and run `npm run build`. Then, under Overwolf's settings, choose Support tab and then Development options. Click the Load unpacked button and choose the "dist" folder.

* In order to load an app as "unpacked", you'll first have to be whitelisted as an Overwolf dev. More details on how to be whitelisted can be found [here](https://overwolf.github.io/docs/start/sdk-introduction#whitelist-as-a-developer)
* To load the typescript version, first you should build it. More details on the readme page under the "ts" folder in this repo.

## Notes

Editing the author or app name in the manifest will prevent loading the app as unpacked app.
